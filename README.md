# dk64r-tracker
Item tracker for Donkey Kong 64 Randomizer, with Firebase support based on Xopar's Extended + Keysanity item tracker in Emotracker.

Use it: https://dk64-rando-tracker.web.app/

This project was originally forked from https://github.com/matthewkirby/ootrr-web-tracker, which was itself forked from https://github.com/stochaztic/lttp-tracker.

If you want to set up your own instance rather than using the public one above, you will need to acquire and set up a Firebase project. You will need to enable anonymous authentication on that project.
